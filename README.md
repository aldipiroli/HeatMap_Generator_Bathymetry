# Generates a heat map for bathymetry data.

#### The data is gathered by a marine drone that has different sensors (PH, depth, oxigen contentration, ..)

#### In order to create a heat map, a clustering polygons algorithm is applied.

#### Finally a color scale is applied on the specific polygon, rappresenting the collected data.
